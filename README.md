# Sneaky Bot
Is our entry for the [Ludum Dare 41 Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/sneaky-bot-1) where the theme was about "Combining Two Incompatible Genres". I think we can all agree that once you combine two incompatible things then they are no longer incompatible. Perhaps a better wording may have been "Combine opposite genres"

To protect the assets created by my fellow team members, I have only included the scripts used to create this game.
