Our entry for the LudumDare 41 Jam Competition.

# Description
You take control of a robot that you’ve hacked to navigate around puzzles using stealth to avoid being detected. Do you have the wits and maneuverability to beat this game?

We suggest to play in “windowed” mode so that you can close the app when done.
